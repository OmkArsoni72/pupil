Most of the content and project requirements are stored in the prd folder.

prompt.md – Contains instructions and context about the project, giving a clear idea of what needs to be done.

db structure – Shows the current database collections and fields, so you know what data we have and how it’s organized.

idk.md – A dump of possibly previous or outdated information. It’s important to keep it rather than delete it, even if it may not be relevant now.

lanngraph.md – Shows the basic implementation I’m hoping for; use it as a reference for structure and logic.

content_agent.md – The PRD that defines the actual work that needs to be implemented.

this_project_folder.md= the structure you might need this sometimes

Important things to keep in mind:

There are only two routes:

contentGeneration for ahs

contentGeneration for remedies

Always refer to the PRDs when executing tasks—they reflect my thought process and requirements.

PRDs may not always be perfectly accurate. Treat them as guidance, not strict rules.
